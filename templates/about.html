<p class="abouttext">We thrive to deliver fresh, healthy, vegan, 100% natural products, following a minimalistic approach. All dishes at our cafe are plant-based, gluten-free, and sugar-free. The majority of products that we use are locally-delivered, bio, organic, and low-processed. We want every person coming through our doors to leave inspired by plants, completely satisfied, and, most importantly, truly nourished.
<br><br>We are on a mission to try and reduce the pollution of our planet. All our takeaway boxes, bags, cups, cutlery, and napkins are 100% biodegradable. We compost and recycle all the waste that we produce when working.

<div class="story">
<div class="textwithlink" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500" data-aos-offset="0">
<p class="abouttext">Grow started as a juice bar in March 2017. In June 2018 we started including more food options to our menu - smoothies, smoothie bowls, salads - all vegan and fresh. Since then we expanded our menu to some more complex plant-based dishes - keeping our initial fresh, low-processed foundation. Our philosophy remained the same throughout all of these years.
<br><br>Grow is a small, local place. The restaurant has been at the same location since it opened and has been one of the rare constants in a rapidly evolving neighbourhood.
